# EmployeeApp-JS-GroupXX
Welcome to our Employee Management App project! This repository contains the code for managing employee data using JavaScript. Our group members are Nmesoma Jeff-Nwankwo, Princess Asare, and Izzedin Ishimwe.

## Exercise Objectives
### The main objectives of this exercise are:

* Practice Object-Oriented Programming principles in JavaScript.
* Implement encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
* Develop a functional EmployeeApp to manage employee data in a group setting.
  
# Steps

### Setting Up the Repository

* Create a new GitHub repository named EmployeeApp-JS-GroupXX.
* Initialize the repository with a README.md file explaining the exercise objectives, steps, functionalities, and your group members' names.
* Create a JavaScript file named EmployeeApp.js to house your group's code.
  
### Designing the Employee Class

* Implement encapsulation with private properties: id, name, department, salary, and corresponding getters.
* Create a constructor function to initialize Employee objects with id, name, department, and salary.
  
### Inheritance

* Create a Manager subclass inheriting from the Employee class.
* Add a private property (bonus) to the Manager class.
* Override the getSalary method in the Manager class to include the bonus.
  
### Polymorphism

* Implement a calculatePaycheck method in both Employee and Manager classes.
* Employee class: return salary.
* Manager class: calculate total salary with bonus.
  
### Implementing the EmployeeApp

* Create an array (employees) to store Employee objects.
* Implement functions to add new employees and display the employee list.
* Divide and conquer approach to finding employees by ID.

### Bonus Features

* Enhance the app with functionalities like updating employee information, deleting employees, and filtering/sorting employees.
* Implement a user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Committing and Pushing to GitHub

* Regularly commit code changes with meaningful messages reflecting individual and group contributions.
* Use Git branching and merging strategies to manage different code contributions effectively.
